# Exno.8-Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation
## NAME: Surendar N
## Register no: 212222040165
# Aim: 
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation
# Algorithm: 
Explore how various prompting techniques can be used to generate and manipulate audio content (e.g., music, sound effects, voice narration) using AI model
# AI Tools Required:
    AudioCraft (music & sound effects generation)
    ElevenLabs (voice narration synthesis)
    Suno AI (ambient music generation)
# PROMPTS & OUTPUT:
## Audio 1: Dynamic Sci-Fi Soundscape
### Prompt:
 “Generate a 3-minute futuristic sci-fi ambient soundscape featuring low-frequency drones, intermittent mechanical whirrs, and occasional robotic beeps. The atmosphere should evoke exploration of an alien spaceship corridor, mysterious and tense, with distant echoing footsteps.”

## PROCEDURE
### 1. Using AudioCraft & Suno AI for Non-Speech Audio
    Visit the AudioCraft or Suno AI platform.
    Enter descriptive prompts specifying mood, instruments, sound effects, and duration.
    Generate audio clips and download in your preferred format.

### 2. Using ElevenLabs for Voice Narration
    Log in to ElevenLabs (https://elevenlabs.io).
    Navigate to “Speech Synthesis.”
    Paste storytelling text or narration prompts.
    Choose a suitable voice (e.g., Emma, Rachel, or custom voices).
    Adjust voice parameters: stability, style, and expressiveness.
    Generate and download the narration audio.


### 3. Mixing Audio Layers
    Use free DAW software like Audacity or GarageBand.
    Import background music, ambient sound effects, and narration files.
    Balance volumes and apply fades to create smooth transitions.
    Export final mixed track.
